# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to apply analyses, visualization, and statistical skills and learn how to retrieve specific data from a website using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library, Python CityPy Module, Python Requests, APIâ€™s, and JSON traversals. 

## Summary

The initial analysis consisted of the following tasks:
* Perform tasks using new Python libraries and modules.
* Retrieve and use data from an API "get" request to a server.
* Retrieve and store values from a JSON array.
* Use try and except blocks to resolve errors.
* Write Python functions.
* Create scatter plots using the Matplotlib library, and apply styles and features to a plot.
* Perform linear regression and add regression lines to scatter plots.
* Create heatmaps, and add markers using the Google Maps API.

The challenge consisted of: 
* Adding the weather description to the weather data retrieved in the intial analysis. 
* Create input statements to filter the data for weather preferences used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
* Four cities were chosen to create a travel itinerary from the list of potential travel destinations. 
* Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route was created between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
